*"Have you ever desired a TF2 Music kit? Do you yearn to feel the adrenaline pumping through your veins with only 60 seconds left? Well, my friend, you're in luck! Introducing the revolutionary micro-vinyl player, seamlessly integrated into your own brain, to cater to your desires as a true mercenary!"*

Re: Musical Events TF2C Port is the unofficial continuation of Musical Event TF2C port created by pointhurt, which was deleted by author from GameBanana. This is a huge pack of sounds that will play when certain event occurs, something kind of like music kits from CSGO. Details below:

There are 2 editions of this mod:
* **Barebones** - It is TF2C Styled with TF2C Spirit music kit for basic events made for die-hard TF2C fans who adore its one of a kind special TF2C artstyle (such as myself). It is more polished; it won't break your "TF2C immersion".

* ~~**Definitive** - An extensive, personal and, well, definitive edition for the standard pack. It still has this TF2C spirit, yet its like a big goo of every TF2C theme (EOTL, Invasion, FRONTLINE, OF, 2007 era, etc.). It comes with more musical events, as well as its multiple random variations, but it is highly experimental, so there are more overlapping sounds I couldn't fix with simple soundscripts files.~~ __Definitive version will be coming at the later date; for now Porting Bare bones to TF2C is the first priority.__

## Bonus Contents
This took inspiration from (check them out they're really neat)
- [Musical Announcer](https://gamebanana.com/sounds/60072) by [FlowerX](https://gamebanana.com/members/1744970)
- [Team Fortress 2 Classic & Open Fortress Menu Songs](https://gamebanana.com/sounds/50339) by [A Paint Bucket Named Huey](https://gamebanana.com/members/1515334)

**This mod is designed for [Team Fortress 2 Classic](https://tf2classic.com) only. Looking for Team Fortress 2 version? Check out the original [Musical Events](https://gamebanana.com/sounds/53978)!**

## Notice
* All rights to these sounds belong to the artist and no copyright infringement is intended. If you own this work and want the content removed, please ask me first.
* Some of the sounds are edited/looped to fit the events.
* All of these work on most `sv_pure 1` servers! (Although it works flawlessly, bug-free on sv_pure <=0 servers!)
* Audio may overlap if the wave/event is shorter than its corresponding song. SOUND STACKING CANNOT BE FIXED (with simple soundscripts) AS FOR NOW.
* This mod uses custom soundscripts! That means its incompatible with other mods that changes the game_sounds.txt, game_sounds_vo.txt and game_sounds_music.txt files!
* This mod uses announcer voicelines, so it's incompatible with custom announcer mods.
* This is a clientside script, not a server plugin!
* This mod is developed purely for fun and does not generate any revenue.
* Feel free to mod it!
